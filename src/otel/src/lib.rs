//! OpenTelemetry trace export for FreeUnit.
//!
//! Two OTLP transports, selected at runtime by `settings/telemetry/protocol`:
//! `"http"` (default) uses the blocking reqwest client and needs no async
//! executor; `"grpc"` uses tonic over a small multi-thread tokio runtime that
//! this crate owns (built lazily, dropped on shutdown). Both are driven by the
//! stable dedicated-thread `BatchSpanProcessor`. v1 is plaintext only — no TLS
//! to the collector on either transport.
//!
//! A finished span is handed to C as a raw `*mut BoxedSpan`. Ending the span
//! (on drop in `nxt_otel_rs_send_trace`) enqueues it into the batch processor,
//! which exports it from its own background thread.
