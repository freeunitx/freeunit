 * One span attribute in a batch.  Mirrored by nxt_otel_attr_t in

 *
 * The Rust struct is #[repr(C)], so both sides lay their fields out under
 * the target's C ABI: a change mirrored on both sides, reordering included,
 * stays in agreement on every target.  What breaks the FFI is editing one
 * side only, or pairing fields whose types are not the same size and
 * alignment everywhere we ship -- C long is 4 bytes on ILP32 where Rust i64
 * is always 8, and C enum sizes are implementation-defined, which is why
 * key_id and type are uint32_t here rather than nxt_otel_attr_id_t.
 *
 * The offsets below are the same on x86-64, armv7 and i386 (the total size
 * is not: 32 on 64-bit, 24 on 32-bit, where int64_t needs only 4-byte
 * alignment).  They are asserted rather than described, so that a field
 * added, reordered or appended here fails the build and prompts the matching
 * edit on the Rust side, which these assertions cannot see.
 *
 * The size assertion is what covers a field appended after sval: the offset
 * checks alone would all still hold, while the struct grew.  That matters
 * more than it looks, because these are passed as an array -- a C-side-only
 * trailing field changes the stride C writes with and not the one Rust reads
 * with, so every attribute after the first would be misread.
