/*
 * Regression test for issue #310: under "isolation": {"namespaces": {"pid":
 * true}} a worker that died before PROCESS_CREATED left the main process
 * holding the record, the port and the descriptor it made at WHOAMI time
 * until the prototype itself exited.
 *
 * The prototype cannot report it with REMOVE_PID.  A pid is that message's
 * whole payload and the only pid the prototype has for such a worker is the
 * namespace-local one it got from fork(), which names an unrelated process in
 * every other namespace -- a prototype's local counter climbs straight into
 * the range the daemon's own pids occupy, so a broadcast would close a live
 * sibling's, the router's or the controller's ports.
 *
 * Main is the one process that can resolve it, because it is the one that
 * holds both names.  A worker's WHOAMI arrives with the kernel-translated
 * global pid in SCM_CREDENTIALS and with the worker's own namespace-local pid
 * in the message header, and nxt_main_process_name_child() keeps the pair.
 * NXT_PORT_MSG_REMOVE_CHILD_PID then carries the local name, and the handler
 * looks for it only among the children of the sender the kernel names.
 *
 * So the two halves are driven separately here.
 *
 * The naming half keeps the pair whenever the two pids are sourced
 * independently, which is what NXT_USE_CMSG_PID says, and keeps it even when
 * they are numerically equal: the two counters are independent, a global pid
 * that has wrapped can land on the small number a namespace-local one holds,
 * and refusing the pair on that equality would leave exactly the record this
 * path exists to retire.  What it must refuse is a name a live sibling
 * already holds, since the number is chosen by the sender -- otherwise a
 * compromised worker could have main retire a sibling's record on the next
 * report.
 *
 * Where NXT_USE_CMSG_PID is not defined the two pids are one value read
 * twice, nxt_main_process_name_child() is compiled away, and the half that
 * can be asserted is the absence: no worker is ever named, so no report can
 * ever resolve one and the router is never told anything.  That is what the
 * arms below assert there, rather than skipping.
 *
 * The resolving half must refuse a sender that is not a prototype, a sender
 * main has no record of, a payload that cannot hold a pid, and a pid that is
 * not one of that sender's children; and on the one case it accepts it must
 * both retire the record locally and tell the router by the global pid, which
 * is the number the router would have been given by an ordinary REMOVE_PID.
