/*
 * Regression test for the CREATING-state start wedge: an application worker
 * that died between fork() and PROCESS_CREATED was never reported to anyone,
 * so the START_PROCESS RPC it was forked for stayed armed forever and the
 * record the main process had already made for it was never retired.
 *
 * Every child of the prototype exists to satisfy a START_PROCESS request, and
 * the router arms an RPC handler for each one.  A child that got as far as
 * PROCESS_CREATED is reported by REMOVE_PID, which carries ->stream, and
 * nxt_router_remove_pid_handler() turns a stream-bearing REMOVE_PID into an
 * RPC error.  A child still in the CREATING state took neither path:
 * nxt_proto_sigchld_handler() skipped the notification for it -- rightly,
 * since REMOVE_PID says nothing but a pid and under pid isolation the
 * prototype does not yet know a globally valid one -- and nothing else
 * answered instead.
 *
 * The prototype's own death is covered: the router keys that RPC on the
 * prototype (nxt_router_start_app_process_handler() calls
 * nxt_port_rpc_ex_set_peer(), src/nxt_router.c), so REMOVE_PID for the
 * prototype reaches nxt_port_rpc_remove_peer() and fails the start.  A child
 * that dies while CREATING has no such backstop: the armed handler owns an
 * app->pending_processes slot, and a leaked slot makes
 * nxt_router_app_can_start() false for good once the application's max is
 * reached -- the application never starts another process, and a reload
 * recovers only if its own config text changed.
 *
 * Answering the initiator is not the whole job.  A worker that got as far as
 * WHOAMI made main create a process record and a port holding main's end of
 * the worker's port socket (nxt_main_process_whoami_handler()), and REMOVE_PID
 * is the only thing that retires it -- nxt_proc_remove_notify_matrix pairs a
 * dying APP with MAIN.  Once the start RPC is retired and requests retry, a
 * worker that keeps dying in that window costs main one record and one
 * descriptor per attempt.  So the CREATING case must both answer the initiator
 * and send a streamless REMOVE_PID: streamless because the initiator has
 * already been answered, and a stream-bearing one would fail the same RPC
 * twice.
 *
 * That REMOVE_PID may only be sent when the pid in it is a usable global key,
 * which is what rt->is_pid_isolated says -- the same test nxt_process_create()
 * uses to decide whether a forked child may enter the runtime hash at all.
 * The pid-isolated case is exercised here too, and it asserts the opposite:
 * nothing at all must reach main, because sending a namespace-local pid would
 * ask main to remove whatever unrelated process holds that number.
 *
 * The answer itself can fail to be written -- a full port queue or a failed
 * allocation, neither of which leaves anything for the initiator -- and then
 * ->stream must survive so that the REMOVE_PID carries it and the router turns
 * it into the RPC error the way it always has for a CREATED child.  Clearing
 * it regardless would rebuild the wedge, silently.
 *
 * All four cases are driven against one router port and one main port,
 * because the point is the split between them.
