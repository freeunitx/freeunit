/*
 * Regression test for descriptor ownership in
 * nxt_port_process_ready_handler() (src/nxt_port.c).
 *
 * PROCESS_READY normally carries the queue descriptor of the process that
 * announces itself, and the handler hands it to that process's port.  A
 * message naming a pid the runtime does not know took an early return that
 * closed nothing, and a repeated READY re-ran the mapping and dropped the
 * previous one -- both leak a descriptor of the receiver, which is the
 * main or the prototype process.  The dispatcher does not reclaim fds once
 * the handler returns (see nxt_port_recv_msg_close_fds()), so a peer that
 * attaches descriptors to forged messages can exhaust a privileged
 * process's descriptor table.
 *
 * A message can carry two descriptors regardless of how many its type
 * normally uses, so the test attaches both and expects both back.
 *
 * The handler also authenticates the sender against the isolated_pid of
 * the process the message names, wherever the platform hands the receiver
 * a kernel-validated pid (NXT_USE_CMSG_PID).  The fixture models a
 * pid-isolated process -- pid and isolated_pid deliberately differ -- so
 * that the cases below can tell the two apart: a credential equal to the
 * global pid has to be refused just like a foreign one.
 *
 * The last case covers what the handler does with process->stream, the start
 * RPC the initiator armed: it is retired when the announcement that answers
 * that RPC has gone out, and kept when it has not.  See issue #271.

/*
 * Take one of this file's fixture ports down.
 *
 * nxt_port_close() releases the descriptors and the queue mapping only; the
 * reference nxt_port_new() took is still held, so the port's own memory pool
 * leaks unless that reference is dropped too.  nxt_runtime_port_remove() does
 * not help here: every fixture port in this file is created *after*
 * nxt_runtime_process_add(), which registers in rt->ports only what the
 * process already carries, so the hash never learned about these ports and
 * the remove returns early without touching the count.
 *
 * The drop has to go through nxt_process_port_remove() first.  The port is
 * linked into the fixture process's queue by hand rather than through
 * nxt_process_port_add(), so port->process is NULL; nxt_port_release()'s own
 * unlink is fine, but the nxt_process_use(task, port->process, -1) it makes
 * afterwards is a NULL dereference for this port.  The link is cleared
 * explicitly because nxt_queue_remove() only zeroes it under NXT_DEBUG, and
 * the check that guards that branch reads it in every build.
 *
 * The guard below on port->link.next mirrors the one nxt_port_release()
 * itself uses (src/nxt_port.c:238): nxt_port_new() zeroes port->link, and
 * nxt_queue_remove() on a zeroed link dereferences NULL at
 * (link)->next->prev, so only a port actually linked may be unlinked.  Every
 * current call site links its port right after creating it with no branch
 * in between, so the guard never trips today; it stays so a future call
 * site that fails the link does not resurrect the crash this helper exists
 * to avoid.

 * the worker is unreachable on this port forever, and the start has to
 * fail rather than be marked ready.

 * is when the NEW_PORT announcement carrying the stream has gone out, not
 * when the READY state has been set.
 *
 * The two are not the same moment.  The state is set first and the
 * announcement is written afterwards, so a READY whose announcement fails
 * leaves the initiator with no reply at all; the only thing that can still
 * fail its RPC is the stream in the REMOVE_PID this process's death will
 * send (src/nxt_router.c:1148-1153).  Clearing on the state -- which is
 * what nxt_main_process_sigchld_handler() used to do -- throws that away.
 * Keeping it forever is the other error the issue names: stream numbers come
 * from one counter that every request draws on, so after a wrap an ordinary
 * exit retires somebody else's live RPC.
 *
 * The fixture is a process announcing itself with no queue descriptor, on a
 * prototype port: that is a real shape (only libunit attaches a queue, and
 * the core processes that announce to main do not), and it keeps the
 * announcement free of descriptors, so the peer's queued message can be
 * drained without closing a descriptor another port owns.
 *
 * The peer is a router, because nxt_proc_send_matrix[] pairs ROUTER with
 * PROTOTYPE; without a peer the announcement would have nothing to fail on
 * and both cases would pass vacuously.  Its port has no socket and is not
 * write-ready, so nxt_port_socket_write2() queues rather than writes, and
 * nxt_port_test_msg_alloc_failures() can fail that queueing on demand.
