# Check that the NXT_TESTS hooks reach the test programs and nothing else.
#
# A "hook" is a fault-injection branch or counter compiled into the core or
# into libunit only for the C test suite, inside "#if (NXT_TESTS)".  With
# "./configure --tests", "make tests" compiles every core and libunit source
# twice: build/src/X.o without the macro and build/src/X.test.o with it
# (auto/make).  unitd, libnxt.a, libunit.a and the language modules are built
# from the plain objects; the test programs link libnxt-tests.a and
# libunit-tests.a, built from the instrumented ones.
#
# The script derives everything from the build.  It keeps no list of hook
# names or hooked sources, so a new hook needs no change here.
#
# hook symbols:  the symbols defined in X.test.o and not in X.o.  Names that
#                contain a "." are compiler-made clones (foo.isra.0, foo.cold)
#                and are skipped; a hook is a C identifier.
# members:       the global symbols of X.test.o that no other instrumented
#                object also defines.  A program that defines one of them
#                linked object X, from one of the two archives.  A name that
#                a second object defines proves nothing about which one was
#                linked: gcc on i386 gives every PIC object that needs one a
#                global __x86.get_pc_thunk.*, and clang's ASan gives every
#                object a global ___asan_globals_registered.  Compiler-made
#                names (those with a ".") are left out as well.
#
# Checks, in order:
#
#   0. NXT_TESTS is not in build/include/nxt_auto_config.h, and at least one
#      hook symbol exists.  If the macro leaked into the plain objects, X.o and
#      X.test.o are the same and the hook set is empty; that is a failure, not
#      a pass.
#   1. Every src/**/*.c outside src/test/ that mentions NXT_TESTS has a
#      build/src/X.test.o, and that object differs from X.o once debug info
#      is removed.  A hook in a source that is compiled once (for example
#      src/nxt_main.c or a module source) would ship; a plain object that
#      equals its instrumented twin was compiled with the macro.  A library
#      source whose feature is off (src/nxt_openssl.c without --openssl) is
#      in auto/sources but not in $build/Makefile.  It is not compiled, and
#      is skipped.
#   2. No shipped artifact defines a hook symbol: build/sbin/unitd,
#      build/lib/libnxt.a, build/lib/libunit.a, build/src/nxt_unit.o (the
#      object the language modules link), and, when present, build/lib/libnxt.so
#      and every build/*.unit.so.
#   3. Every test program that linked object X defines every hook of X.  This
#      proves it took X from the instrumented archive, not the plain one.
#
