# Contributing to FreeUnit

Thank you for helping keep Unit alive.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug reports** — open an issue with reproduction steps
- **Security fixes** — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- **PHP 8.5+ support** — our primary focus
- **Documentation** — fixes and improvements always welcome
- **CI/CD** — help improve our build pipeline

## Getting Started

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/freeunitorg/freeunit
$ cd freeunit
$ ./configure --openssl --otel
$ make
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/your-fix`
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes
5. Submit a pull request against `master`

## Labels

Every issue and PR must carry labels so triage and release notes stay
accurate. Maintainers (or the contributor, if able) apply at least:

- **One type** — `z-bug 🐞`, `z-enhancement ⬆️`, `z-question`, or the
  upstream `T-Defect` / `T-Enhancement` / `T-Other`.
- **One area** — the language module (`z-php`, `z-python`, `z-rust`, …)
  or `z-c` for core C, `z-infrastructure`, `z-packages`, `z-toolchain`.
- **Severity, when it applies** — `z-crasher` for a segfault/abort,
  `X-Release-Blocker` for anything that must ship in the next release.

Run `gh label list` to see the full set. To apply labels to a PR:

```console
$ gh pr edit <num> --add-label "z-bug 🐞" --add-label "z-c"
```

If `gh pr edit` fails with a Projects-classic deprecation error, use
the REST API instead:

```console
$ gh api repos/freeunitorg/freeunit/issues/<num>/labels -X POST \
      -f "labels[]=z-bug 🐞" -f "labels[]=z-c"
```

PR titles must follow Conventional Commits (see below), not the branch
name — rename a `feature/foo` PR to `feat(scope): …` before merge.

## Code Style

Follow the existing C code style in the project.
Run the test suite before submitting:

```console
$ sudo pytest-3 --print-log test/
```

If you changed core C code or libunit, also run the C test suite:

```console
$ ./configure --tests --openssl
$ make
$ make build/lib/libunit.a
$ make tests
$ ./build/tests
```

`--tests` builds the test programs (`build/tests`,
`build/unit_port_recv_test`, and the rest). It does not change `unitd`,
`libnxt.a`, `libunit.a`, or any language module: those come from the
same objects with or without `--tests`.

If you touch a source file under `#if (NXT_TESTS)`, run the gate script
after `make tests`. It fails if a test hook reaches a shipped artifact:

```console
$ .github/scripts/check-test-hooks.sh
```

Build once with `./configure --hardening=strict` before you submit.
New code must compile warning-free under it: no variable-length
arrays, and `nxt_fallthrough;` instead of a fall-through comment. For
length arithmetic on untrusted input, use `nxt_size_add()` and
`nxt_size_mul()` from `src/nxt_checked.h`. For record parsing, use
`nxt_span_t` from `src/nxt_span.h`.

Two CI checks look at each pull request. `ast-grep baseline` runs the
rules in `tools/ast-grep/` over `src/`, without `src/test/`. It fails on
a match that is not in `tools/ast-grep/baseline.json`. It also fails on
a stale entry: an entry in `baseline.json` that no match uses any more.
When you fix a match, remove its entry, or run the `--update` command
below. The rules find some known shapes only. A green check does not
show that the code uses `nxt_size_add()` or `nxt_span_t` where it must:
for example, a sum of three lengths or a hand-written `p + n <= end`
check does not match. `require a test for a src/ change` warns when a PR changes a
file under `src/` and no file under `test/` or `src/test/`. If the
change needs no test, add the `no-test-needed` label, or a trailer with
the reason to one of your commits:

```
No-Test-Reason: the change only renames a local variable
```

To run the ast-grep check before you push (ast-grep 0.45.3 must be
installed):

```console
$ ast-grep test -c tools/ast-grep/sgconfig.yml
$ python3 tools/ast-grep/check_baseline.py
```

When a new match is reviewed and safe, run
`python3 tools/ast-grep/check_baseline.py --update` and commit
`baseline.json` with the change.

## Commit Messages
