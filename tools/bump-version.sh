# The sites are the rows of .github/scripts/version-sites; this script
# keeps no list of its own.  It edits the rows of kind line, vernum,
# cargo-package and cargo-lock, and runs "make dockerfiles" for the
# dockerfiles row.  Running it twice with the same version changes nothing.
#
# It does not write text that needs a person: the rows of kind
# changelog-md, security-md and changes (the CHANGES date, the two
# docs/changes.xml stanzas, the unitctl CHANGELOG section and the
# SECURITY.md table).  It ends with .github/scripts/check-version.sh,
# which names what is still missing.  Edit those files, run the check
# again, and make the release commit by hand.  This script does not
# commit.
#
# Run it in a clean tree.  If it stops with an error, the rows before the
# error are already edited; "git checkout -- ." restores them.
