"""
Functional tests for the two-phase listener close.

These tests exercise the new "draining" state on nxt_listen_event_t.
The state machine they cover is:

    Accepting -> Draining: nxt_router_listen_socket_close() phase 1
                           (accept(2) disarmed, draining = 1)
    Draining  -> Closed:   nxt_router_listen_socket_close_finish() phase 2
                           (FD released once lev->count == 1)

The previous behaviour was to run phase 1 and phase 2 back-to-back from a
zero-timeout timer, which RST'd in-flight TLS handshakes and any
accepted-but-not-yet-handled connection on a busy listener.
