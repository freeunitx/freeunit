"""Proxy duplicate upstream Content-Length regression test (#113).

An upstream that sends a second Content-Length header is a classic
response-smuggling primitive: the two values disagree on where the body ends,
so a proxy that forwards them lets the client and any intermediary re-frame
the body against each other. The hardening in nxt_http_proxy_content_length
logs a warning, sets skip=1 on BOTH Content-Length fields so neither is
forwarded, and resets content_length_n to -1 so the body is framed by
read-to-EOF instead of an ambiguous advertised length.

Client-observable outcome, confirmed against the running router: a 200
response carrying NO Content-Length header at all -- FreeUnit re-frames the
body itself as Transfer-Encoding: chunked -- with the exact upstream body
bytes and a complete terminal chunk. The client never sees the two ambiguous
lengths, so there is no framing disagreement to exploit.

Note on the inconsistent flag: nxt_http_proxy_content_length sets
r->inconsistent so the downstream keepalive is disabled. This was previously
clobbered -- nxt_h1p_peer_closed reassigned the flag from the (already reset)
framing state on the clean upstream close, so the connection stayed
keep-alive. That is fixed: peer_closed now only *sets* a separate r->truncated
(which drives the terminal-chunk omission) and never clears r->inconsistent,
so a complete-but-ambiguous body disables keepalive while keeping its terminal
chunk. test_proxy_dup_cl_keepalive_disabled below asserts that directly. The
first two tests drive `Connection: close` and assert the primary defense on
the wire: zero conflicting Content-Length headers reach the client and the
relayed body framing is unambiguous.

Driven by the `dup-cl` mode of the Rust mock upstream (test/fake_upstream/):
it sends `Content-Length: 20` then `Content-Length: 6`, followed by a 20-byte
deterministic body, then closes. This test was deferred from #113 to land
with the fake_upstream harness (#100). Language-module-free (gated only on
built-in proxy support) so it runs on the minimal test build.
