"""
Regression test for issue #28: CLOSE-WAIT accumulation under port-scan load.

When a client sends FIN on an HTTP/1.1 keep-alive connection, Unit must
call close() promptly — not wait for idle_timeout to expire.  Previously
the connections lingered in CLOSE_WAIT causing FD exhaustion and CPU spin.

Strategy:
  1. Open N keepalive connections to Unit (built-in "return 200" route,
     no language module required).
  2. Half-close each socket (send FIN via shutdown(SHUT_WR)).
  3. Poll /proc/net/tcp for CLOSE_WAIT on the listener port.
  4. Assert none remain after a short grace period.
