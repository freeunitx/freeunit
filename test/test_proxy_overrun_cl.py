"""Proxy Content-Length *overrun* relay regression test.

An upstream that sends more body bytes than its Content-Length advertises must
not have the excess relayed downstream: FreeUnit already sent that same
Content-Length to the client, so forwarding the surplus is what would enable
response splitting on a kept-alive connection. The hardening in
nxt_h1p_peer_body_process truncates the buf chain to the advertised length,
flags the response inconsistent (disabling keep-alive) and closes the
connection.

This test asserts the mechanism that prevents splitting -- the client receives
exactly the advertised bytes and no more -- rather than driving a second
pipelined request; a single request with `Connection: close` is enough to
observe the truncation.

Driven by the `overrun-cl` mode of the Rust mock upstream
(test/fake_upstream/): it declares `Content-Length: 100` but writes 150 bytes.
Deliberately language-module-free (gated only on the built-in proxy support) so
it runs on the minimal test build.
