"""How the proxy frames an upstream response by its Transfer-Encoding.

nxt_h1p_peer_transfer_encoding() used to accept only the exact value
"chunked".  RFC 9112 Sect. 6.1 makes coding names case-insensitive and the
value a comma-separated list.  So "Chunked" or "gzip, chunked" was not seen
as chunked.  The body was then framed by Content-Length or by connection
close, and the chunk framing reached the client as body bytes.

The proxy decodes only chunked, and it never forwards Transfer-Encoding to
the client.  So the whole list must be one "chunked", in any letter case.
Whitespace and empty list elements around it are allowed.  Every other
Transfer-Encoding gives 502.  Chunked together with Content-Length also
gives 502 (RFC 9112 Sect. 6.3).  Content-Length never frames a body that
has a Transfer-Encoding.

Neither 502 applies to a response the same Sect. 6.3 says has no body: a
response to HEAD, and any 204 or 304, ends at the first empty line whatever
Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length say.  There is no body to decode there,
so those responses are completed as bodyless and relayed normally.  The
keep-alive half of that path is pinned in test_proxy_head.py, whose pipeline
idiom the bodyless cases below reuse.

The upstream is a plain Python socket server.  The request target selects
the case.
