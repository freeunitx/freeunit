/*
 * LD_PRELOAD shim that makes capget(2) fail the way a syscall filter
 * makes it fail, for test_capget_fallback.py.
 *
 * src/nxt_capability.c reaches the kernel through the nxt_capget()
 * macro, which expands to glibc's syscall() wrapper -- an ordinary
 * interposable symbol, not a compiler builtin or an inline "syscall"
 * instruction.  So a preloaded definition of syscall() shadows it and
 * we can inject an errno without needing seccomp, a privileged
 * helper, or a container.
 *
 * The interposition is total: every syscall() in the process, from
 * every library, comes through here.  Only SYS_capget is ever
 * answered locally, and only when NXT_TEST_CAPGET_ERRNO names an
 * errno; everything else is forwarded to the real symbol untouched.
 *
 * Set NXT_TEST_CAPGET_RECORD to a file path to have every pid whose
 * capget() we failed appended to it, one per line.  The test uses
 * that to show which processes the filter actually reached -- the
 * environment is inherited by unitd's children, so "no other process
 * was affected" has to be demonstrated rather than assumed.
 *
 * That path is copied, not kept as the getenv() pointer, and the copy
 * is what makes the demonstration mean anything.  getenv() returns a
 * pointer into the contiguous argv+environ block, and
 * nxt_process_title() (src/nxt_process_title.c) writes the process
 * title over that block and zero-pads the remainder, so in every
 * process unitd forks the inherited pointer would read as "" and
 * open("") would fail silently.  The main process looked correct only
 * by accident of ordering: nxt_capability_set() runs from
 * nxt_runtime_conf_init(), before nxt_main_process_title()
 * (src/nxt_main_process.c:96) rewrites the area.  A record file that
 * no child could have written to proves nothing about what the
 * children did.
 *
 * NXT_TEST_CAPSET_RECORD does the same for capset(2).  That is how the
 * test observes nxt_capability_drop(): the drop has no visible effect
 * in a suite that runs without any capability to drop, so "the app has
 * no capabilities" would pass just as well without the code.  Which
 * *processes* called capset() is the part that cannot pass by
 * accident: main must never appear (it keeps CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE for
 * bind()), the prototype must, and the application worker must not,
 * because it inherits the prototype's already-emptied sets rather than
 * dropping again.
 *
 * NXT_TEST_CAPGET_HOLD is the other direction: a hex mask that makes
 * capget(2) *succeed* and report that mask in the permitted, effective
 * and inheritable sets of the first data element.  The suite runs as an
 * ordinary user with no capabilities, so without it there is nothing to
 * refuse over -- nxt_capability_still_held() would correctly answer
 * "empty" and the refusal below would never fire.  Faking the answer is
 * what lets an unprivileged pytest reach the code the harness smoke test
 * reaches with real ambient capabilities.
 *
 * The mask the test passes is CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE, deliberately: main's
 * own capget() sees it too, and nxt_capability_specific_set() only looks
 * for CAP_SETUID, CAP_SETGID and CAP_SYS_CHROOT, so unitd still starts
 * and behaves exactly like the unprivileged process it really is.  A
 * mask containing CAP_SETUID would make it attempt a setuid() it cannot
 * perform.
 *
 * NXT_TEST_CAPSET_ERRNO makes capset(2) fail the same way, which is
 * the other half of a "SystemCallFilter=" allowlist: a profile that
 * omits capget() almost always omits capset() too.  The call is still
 * recorded before it is failed, so the record says who *tried*.  Unit
 * answers that differently per process -- a prototype refuses to start
 * rather than fork workers that would inherit what it could not drop,
 * while the router, controller and discovery warn and carry on -- so
 * the test needs to be able to produce it.
 *
 * Build:
 *     cc -shared -fPIC -o capget_filter.so capget_filter.c -ldl

     *     builds for.  On x86-64 SysV the first five come from the
     *     register save area gcc/clang spill at entry and the sixth
     *     from the caller's own frame via overflow_arg_area; on

     *     32-bit ABIs the excess reads land in the caller's frame.
     *     None of them can fault, and none of them is used: only
     *     `number` decides what happens below.
     *
     * Whether the shim should install a real seccomp filter instead
     * was weighed and rejected: a filter needs PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS,
     * after which it is inherited across both fork() and execve(), so
     * every unitd child would see capget() fail too -- and the record
     * file below, whose whole value is showing that only main was
     * affected, could no longer say anything.  It would also filter
     * capset() in the children, which is the call the drop depends on.
