# FreeUnit Test Suite

## CRITICAL: Docker-only

**ALL build and test commands MUST run inside Docker.** Never run
`./configure`, `make`, `pytest-3`, `python3`, or any language runtime
directly on the host — host drift hides bugs that surface in CI.

Use `./test/run-local.sh` (preferred). For one-shot commands, override
the fixed `ENTRYPOINT` (which is `bash -c "...build...exec pytest-3 $@"`)
and mount at `/unit` (the image `WORKDIR`):

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint bash -v "$(pwd):/unit" -w /unit \
    freeunit-test:local -c '<cmd>'
```

See project-root `CLAUDE.md` for the full allowed/forbidden list.

## Running Tests

Tests require **root privileges** because Unit creates Unix domain sockets,
network namespaces, and cgroups during isolation tests.

### Local Testing via Docker (Recommended)

Build and run tests inside an isolated Docker container that mirrors the CI
environment. No host system dependencies needed — the image is based on
`pkg/docker/template.Dockerfile` and includes Rust, njs, OpenSSL, and all
build tools.

```bash
# Run the full test suite (~30 minutes)
./test/run-local.sh

# Run only Python tests
./test/run-local.sh python

# Run a specific test file
./test/run-local.sh -t test_tls.py

# Run a single test function
./test/run-local.sh -t test_tls.py::test_tls_certificate_change

# Run multiple module test suites
./test/run-local.sh python php perl

# Dry-run — print commands without executing
./test/run-local.sh -n -t test_tls.py

# Show help
./test/run-local.sh -h
```

The script (`test/run-local.sh`) builds a `freeunit-test:local` image
mirroring `pkg/docker/template.Dockerfile` (Debian trixie, Rust 1.95.0,
njs 0.9.6, system libssl-dev). Source code is mounted via Docker volume,
so changes on the host are immediately reflected. The container then
builds FreeUnit with `--tests --openssl --njs --zlib --zstd --brotli --otel`,
builds the Python module, and runs `sudo -E pytest-3 --print-log`.

To force a rebuild of the image (e.g. after Dockerfile changes):
```bash
docker rmi freeunit-test:local
./test/run-local.sh python
```

### Fast prototyping with the pre-built builder image

`run-local.sh` builds a full test image from scratch (downloads Rust, Go, njs)
— slow for tight iteration. For prototyping a **proxy / TLS** test (no language
runtime needed), reuse the pre-built builder image
`ghcr.io/freeunitorg/freeunit-builder:trixie-rust1.95.0` (Rust + all C build
deps already baked in) and just mount the working tree. Build + run is ~30 s:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged -v "$(pwd):/unit" -w /unit \
  ghcr.io/freeunitorg/freeunit-builder:trixie-rust1.95.0 bash -c '
    apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq python3-pytest python3-openssl
    ./configure --openssl --tests
    make -j"$(nproc)" unitd
    cargo build --release --manifest-path test/fake_upstream/Cargo.toml
    cp test/fake_upstream/target/release/fake_upstream /usr/local/bin/
    pytest-3 --print-log test/test_proxy_chunked.py -q
  '
```

Iterate by editing tests on the host (tree is mounted) and re-running; the C
core and `fake_upstream` rebuild incrementally.

**Caveats:**

- **No language module is built**, so a test gated on one is skipped. A test
  file with `prerequisites = {'modules': {'python': 'any'}}` (and a
  `ApplicationPython()` client) skips entirely here. For proxy/TLS-only cases,
  base the test on `ApplicationProto` (plain) or `ApplicationTLS` (TLS) and
  omit the language `prerequisites` so it runs on the minimal `--openssl
  --tests` build.
- The build writes `build/` into the mounted tree as **root**. Run
  `sudo rm -rf build` on the host afterwards, or use `run-local.sh` (copies to
  a tmp dir) when you want isolation.
- This path is for prototyping only. Before pushing, validate with
  `./test/run-local.sh` (full matrix) and, for C changes, the clang-ast check.

### Running Tests Directly on Host

If you prefer to run tests natively (requires all dependencies installed):

The test tools come from the distribution (`python3-pytest`, `python3-openssl`)
or from `pip install -r test/requirements.txt`. That file needs Python 3.10 or
newer, because older pytest and pyOpenSSL releases have known vulnerabilities.
On a host with an older Python, use `./test/run-local.sh` instead.

```bash
# 1. Build FreeUnit with test support
./configure --openssl --njs --zlib --zstd --brotli --otel --tests
make -j$(nproc)

# 2. Build required language modules
sudo ./configure python --config=python3-config
sudo make python3

./configure php
make php

./configure ruby
make ruby

# ... etc.

# 3. Run the full test suite
sudo pytest-3 --print-log test/

# 4. Run a specific test file
sudo pytest-3 --print-log test/test_tls.py

# 5. Run a single test function
sudo pytest-3 --print-log test/test_tls.py::test_tls_certificate_change

# 6. Run with restart mode (Unit restarts after every test)
sudo pytest-3 --print-log --restart test/

# 7. Save logs after execution
sudo pytest-3 --print-log --save-log test/

# 8. Move the suite off the default base port 8080
sudo pytest-3 --print-log --port 18080 test/
```

### Base port (`--port`)

The suite uses `*:8080` and near ports. Only one run can use them in a network
namespace. Use `--port N` to move the suite to a different band. Two runs on
one host must use different bases, for example 8080 and 18080.

`UNIT_TEST_PORT=N` sets the default. `sudo-rs` ignores `-E`, thus use `--port`
under `sudo`.

`test/unit/port.py` adds `N - 8080` to each known port: 8080–8085, 8090, 8443
and the helper ports 7976–7999 (see `test/fake_upstream/README.md`). At the
default base, the map does not change a port. The base must be 8080 plus a
multiple of 1000, up to 32080, so that the bands of two runs do not overlap.

When you write a test:

- `client.get(port=8081)` and `"*:8081"` in a configuration: no change.
- A raw socket, `ssl.get_server_certificate()`, a helper process, or a port
  that Unit sends back: use `port_map.port(8081)`.
- A configuration from `client.conf_get()` that you compare with a literal:
  use `port_map.expected(value)`.

`test_port_map.py` runs `unit/port_lint.py`. It fails when a test uses a known
port that is not mapped. In CI, each leg runs with `--port 18080`, except
go and node: their fixtures name port 8080. Thus each test file runs off-base
on each pull request.

(clang-ast static analysis is Docker-only — see the section below.)

## Static analysis (clang-ast)

`./test/run-local-full.sh` runs the C build under the
`freeunitorg/clang-ast` LLVM plugin inside Docker — catches API-misuse /
lifetime / allocator violations the normal compile misses. Run it before
every commit and PR.

```bash
./test/run-local-full.sh        # build + clang-ast check
./test/run-local-full.sh -n     # dry-run (print, don't execute)
```

Scope: **C core + otel** (configure is `--otel --openssl --debug`), so
`nxt_otel.c` and the otel validators in `nxt_conf_validation.c` are
analyzed. The Rust otel library is built by cargo for linking but is not
seen by the plugin. Other module C (njs, brotli, zlib, zstd) is NOT
analyzed.

**Prebuilt image.** The script pulls
`ghcr.io/freeunitorg/freeunit-clang-ast:trixie` (clang-ast plugin +
rustc/cargo baked in) to skip the slow one-time apt+rust install. The
package is **private** — `docker login ghcr.io` first:

```bash
gh auth token | docker login ghcr.io -u <user> --password-stdin
```

If the pull is denied (no auth / package private), the script falls back
to building the image locally. To force a rebuild:
`docker rmi freeunit-test-full:local`.

## Known Issues

- **`test_tls_certificate_change`** — may fail if a previous test left
  stale TLS state. Re-run the test individually to confirm.
- **`--restart` mode** — significantly slower but catches state leakage
  between tests.
- **Process isolation tests** — require `--privileged` in Docker or real
  root on the host (namespaces, cgroups, pivot_root).

## CI

GitHub Actions runs the tests in `.github/workflows/build-test.yml`. The
language versions come from `pkg/eol.json`.

- A push to `master` runs every version of every runtime.
- A pull request runs every Python version, Perl, WASM and WASI, and one
  version each of Go, Java, Node.js, PHP and Ruby. A runtime whose own files
  change gets every version. A change to `pkg/eol.json`, to `build-test.yml`
  or to `.github/scripts/test-matrix.sh` gives the full matrix. So does the
  `ci-full` label on the pull request.

`.github/scripts/test-matrix.sh` has the rules and the version that a pull
request gets for each runtime.

`.github/workflows/nightly.yml` runs two compile gates on `master` once a
night and on demand: `--hardening=strict` with the runner's gcc and clang,
and a build against upstream OpenSSL 4.0 at a pinned version. Pull requests
and pushes do not run them. A failed nightly run opens or updates a tracking
issue.
