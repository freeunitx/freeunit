"""Application-process lifecycle churn, parametrized over every runtime.

Rationale
---------
The libunit port/fd lifecycle -- nxt_unit_add_port() and the add_port /
remove_port callbacks, nxt_unit_port_release()'s destroy path, and
nxt_unit_process_msg()'s `done:` descriptor cleanup -- lives in the
*application* process, and every runtime links the same src/nxt_unit.c.  A bug
there (a double close(), a leaked descriptor, a use-after-free of a port
struct) surfaces as an "[alert]" line written by the app process into unit.log
during port teardown, or as a slowly growing /proc/<app pid>/fd.

Before this module the suite exercised those paths deliberately in exactly one
runtime -- test_go_application.py's two churn tests, added alongside the Go
port-fd double-close fix.  Every other runtime got only incidental coverage
from the conftest `run` fixture calling Log.check_alerts() after tests that do
little more than "send a request, check the body", so an app-side double close
could reach CI as nothing but an intermittent alert in one runtime's log.

These tests deliberately churn the app-side port/fd lifecycle -- worker count
up and down, /control/.../restart storms, whole-application removal and re-add,
requests in flight across all of it -- and lean on the harness's existing
teardown assertions to fail the run:

  * conftest `run` fixture -> Log.check_alerts(): any "[alert]" from the app
    process (e.g. "close(N) failed: Bad file descriptor") fails the test, and
    any "Sanitizer" line fails it in the ASan/UBSan legs.
  * conftest `_check_fds()`: descriptor leaks in main/router/controller
    (with --fds-threshold=0, the CI default).

plus one assertion the harness makes nowhere else:

  * test_app_lifecycle_app_fds_stable(): descriptor growth inside the
    *application* process itself.

Runtime coverage is table-driven (RUNTIMES below); a runtime that is not built
into this unitd self-skips, so the same file can run in every per-language CI
leg with only that leg's parameter executing.  Adding a runtime is one entry.

CI wiring note: .github/workflows/build-test.yml derives a per-module test glob
(test/test_<module>*), so this file is named explicitly in that job's
`testpath` -- otherwise only the python legs would ever run it.

    """Descriptors of the kinds libunit hands an application process.

    A raw count of /proc/<pid>/fd cannot tell a libunit leak from the host
    runtime opening something of its own, and some runtimes legitimately do:
    a JVM may open a jar, a JIT artefact or an eventfd part-way through a run
    and keep it.  Counting everything made this test fail on java-26 for a
    single descriptor while java-17, 21 and 25 passed -- a difference in the
    JVM, not in the port handling this test exists to watch.

    So count only what the docstring of the test actually claims: sockets
    (ports) and shared memory segments (incoming mmap).  Anything the
    language runtime opens for its own purposes is deliberately out of scope,
    and a real leak of a port or a segment still fails.

    Counted per class rather than as one total, because the classes do not
    behave alike: an application acquires port sockets lazily, one per router
    engine, so their count legitimately rises for a while, while a segment or
    a spool descriptor is closed by the same message that delivered it and
    must never rise at all.  A single total would have to carry the socket
    tolerance, and would then be blind to a per-segment leak.  Separate
    counts let the caller hold each class to its own rule.

    Segments are narrowed further, because "shared memory" is not
    unit-specific -- php's opcache maps /memfd:opcache_lock, and a JVM heap
    can appear as /memfd:java_heap -- so only names carrying `unit.` count.

    Spool files are narrowed by name, not by "regular file under the temp
    dir".  The temp dir is not unit's alone: it holds unit.log, which every
    worker keeps open for its whole life, and ApplicationJava.prepare_env()
    stages the whole webapp into {temp_dir}/java
    (test/unit/applications/lang/java.py), so a directory rule counts the
    JVM's classloader descriptors on WEB-INF/classes/*.class -- exactly the
    runtime-specific noise the narrowing above exists to drop.  A spool file
    is created as mkstemp("<tmp>/req-XXXXXXXX") and unlinked immediately
    (nxt_h1p_request_body_read(), src/nxt_h1proto.c), so its link target is
    `{temp_dir}/req-XXXXXXXX (deleted)`; match that basename.

    The class is kept as a guard, but no test here reaches it: bodies are
    either 2000 bytes (well under the 16 KiB default body_buffer_size) or
    sent by test_app_lifecycle_app_fds_stable, which raises that buffer above
    the body precisely so the body does NOT spool.

    whatever the language runtime maps for itself.  Not named `unit.<pid>.`,
    which drops the segments this process created for its own responses --
    it opens and closes those itself (nxt_unit_new_mmap()), so they carry no
    incoming descriptor to leak.

    """No per-request descriptor growth inside the application process.

    conftest's _check_fds() only watches main/router/controller.  The libunit
    paths that hand descriptors to an app -- incoming mmap segments and port
    sockets -- are only observable here, so a leak of one descriptor per
    request or per incoming segment is invisible to the rest of the suite.

    Per request and per incoming segment is the whole claim.  A leak in the
    one-time paths -- recv_msg->fd[0] in nxt_unit_process_new_port(), say --
    is NOT covered: this test loads the application with processes=1 and
    never restarts or reconfigures it, so every NEW_PORT it sees is a first
    discovery, lands in a single window, and is indistinguishable from the
    legitimate lazy acquisition described below.  Port-announcement churn is
    covered by the other tests in this module, and only through the alerts a
    bad close writes into unit.log (Log.check_alerts()).

    Request spool files are the third kind of descriptor an application is
    handed, and this module deliberately does not exercise them: every body
    it sends is either well under body_buffer_size or accompanied by a
    buffer raised above it.  count_fds() still counts them, as a guard for
    whoever adds the coverage.

    Measured across THREE identical bursts rather than before-and-after one,
    and per descriptor class rather than as one total.  A single burst cannot
    tell a leak from lazy one-time allocation, and the app process does
    allocate lazily.  Counting one window made this fail for a single
    descriptor on java-26 and again on python, both times for growth that
    never repeated.

    Only sockets allocate lazily, so only sockets pay for it:

      * shm and spool descriptors must be flat.  Both are closed by the same
        message that delivered them -- nxt_unit_process_msg()'s `done:` --
        so any growth at all, in either window, is a leak.  Every burst
        forces an incoming segment (below), which keeps a per-segment leak
        visible in a single window rather than cancelling out.

      * sockets are bounded, not flat.  The router runs nxt_ncpu engine
        threads (rtcf->threads, src/nxt_router.c), an application does not
        learn an engine's port until the first request routed through that
        engine, and nxt_unit_process_new_port() keeps that NEW_PORT socket
        (src/nxt_unit.c).  Discovery is one-time PER ENGINE, not per
        process: with several engines still undiscovered after the first
        window, windows two and three can each add one, so "growth in both
        windows" is a legitimate outcome and cannot be the rule.

    The socket rule is therefore one bound, and the discovery ceiling is
    what makes it safe.  There are at most nxt_ncpu engines, the test does
    not touch `listen_threads`, and nxt_ncpu is at most CPU_COUNT() of the
    affinity mask, capped by _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN (nxt_lib.c) -- which is
    what os.sched_getaffinity() reports here.  A cgroup v2 CPU limit can
    only lower nxt_ncpu.  So: total socket growth across the two windows may
    not exceed that ceiling.  Discovery can never exceed it,
    however the first touches fall across the windows -- one window, both,
    or a whole burst's worth of fresh engines on a machine with more CPUs
    than the burst has requests -- so this bound cannot be tripped by the
    engine count.  A per-window bound was tried and dropped for exactly that
    last case: on a host with BURST or more undiscovered engines, BURST fresh
    connections can legitimately retain BURST new port sockets in one window.

    What the socket rule gives up is a socket leak that stays under the
    ceiling: one socket per request adds 2 * BURST over the two windows and
    is caught on any machine with fewer than 2 * BURST CPUs -- every CI
    runner by a wide margin -- but on a larger host, or for a leak slower
    than one per request, growth that sums to no more than nxt_ncpu reads as
    discovery.  That is unavoidable while discovery is live, and it is the
    class where a leak is cheapest to spot elsewhere -- a port descriptor
    mishandled in the churn tests above shows up as an alert.  The classes
    with no tolerance at all are the ones only this test watches.

    Measured on php with this workload reduced to six plain 40-request
    windows, the app's socket count ran 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9: one discovery,
    after the second window, then flat.  The bound passes that; a
    per-request leak (8, 48, 88) trips it on any host under 80 CPUs.

    Pinning the router to one engine would remove the variable at its source,
    and is the more obvious fix -- but `listen_threads` is a live
    reconfiguration, and restoring the default at teardown leaves conftest's
    own _check_fds() looking at a router that has rebuilt its engines, which
    it reports as a 21-descriptor leak in the router.

    Each burst ends with one oversized POST, and that is not decoration.  The
    router creates a segment only when the ones it has for this application
    cannot serve a request, and 2000-byte requests release their chunks as
    they complete, so a burst of them reuses the segment the warm-up caused
    and never makes the router announce another.  A window that received no
    segment cannot show a descriptor leaked per segment -- the one leak this
    test names in its own docstring would be invisible to it, and the flat
    rule would pass a leaking build.  The oversized request forces an
    announcement; the burst asserts that it happened, so the probe cannot
    quietly stop working.

    The POST grows by one segment per burst because the pool grows with it:
    the segments an earlier burst forced are free again by the time the next
    one runs, and would swallow a repeat of the same body.  What stays equal
    across the windows is the thing being counted -- one segment created, one
    descriptor received -- which is what makes the differences between them
    leaks rather than workload differences.

    Runtimes whose application cannot answer such a request keep the bursts
    and lose only the segment part of the claim (see RUNTIMES); driving one
    into a response it cannot build would test the sample app, not libunit.
