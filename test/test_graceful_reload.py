"""
Graceful vs fast shutdown: signal-handler split.

Background
----------
SIGTERM and SIGQUIT used to share an identical handler in
src/nxt_main_process.c -- both routed straight to nxt_runtime_quit()
without distinguishing fast from graceful exit.  The handlers are now
split: SIGQUIT sets rt->quit_mode = NXT_PORT_QUIT_GRACEFUL, and the
NXT_PORT_MSG_QUIT message dispatched by nxt_runtime_stop_app_processes()
carries that byte.  libunit already parses this wire format and
dispatches to nxt_unit_quit(), which lets in-flight requests drain when
the byte is NXT_PORT_QUIT_GRACEFUL.

The plumbing is what these tests exercise behaviourally:

  * SIGQUIT -> in-flight request must complete with status 200.
  * SIGTERM -> in-flight request is dropped (connection reset or truncated).

A third placeholder test asserts the wire-format intent but is skipped
because verifying the actual quit_param byte would require C-level
instrumentation -- the behavioural pair above already covers reachability.

    SIGQUIT to the unitd master must let an in-flight request complete.

    Previously the SIGQUIT path was identical to SIGTERM (both called
    nxt_runtime_quit() with no quit_param plumbing), so libunit defaulted
    to NXT_QUIT_NORMAL and the worker exited immediately.  Now the
    main signal handler stores rt->quit_mode = NXT_QUIT_GRACEFUL and the
    QUIT message body now carries that byte; libunit's nxt_unit_quit()
    drains the active request before tearing the context down.

    Both application flavours matter and exercise different points:

      * wsgi: the worker is busy in time.sleep() and only reads the QUIT
        message after the response -- guards against the worker being
        torn down while it is not polling libunit.  The full response is
        produced before QUIT is seen, so it completes end-to-end.
      * asgi: `await sleep()` yields to the asyncio loop, so libunit
        processes the QUIT byte *while the response is mid-stream* --
        this is the variant that exercises the GRACEFUL worker drain.
        The request echoes a body in two chunks with a sleep in between.
        The response *start* (200 + header-complete) is contractual; the
        full-body echo is only delivered once the router also drains its
        in-flight connections (roadmap P5), so a short body is xfail'd --
        but ONLY after confirming the worker actually drained.  A short
        body accompanied by the "active request on ctx quit" marker means
        SIGQUIT regressed to the NORMAL fast exit, which is still a hard

    SIGTERM remains the fast-exit path: in-flight requests are dropped.

    On SIGTERM, rt->quit_mode = NXT_PORT_QUIT_NORMAL and the QUIT
    message body carries 0; libunit's nxt_unit_quit() returns immediately
    and calls close_handler() on every active request.

    Why ASGI here?  In synchronous WSGI a worker that is busy in
    time.sleep() never pumps libunit's message loop, so the QUIT byte
    sits in the queue until the request has finished anyway.  The
    behavioural difference between QUIT_NORMAL and QUIT_GRACEFUL is only
    observable when libunit can actually process the QUIT message while
    a request is still in-flight -- which is what the asyncio-driven
    ASGI handler enables.  See test/python/delayed/asgi.py: the
    `await sleep(delay)` yields control back to the asyncio loop,
    letting libunit's add_reader callback run the QUIT path.

    Regression evidence is the "active request on ctx quit" warning --
    libunit emits it from the for-loop that walks
    active_req inside nxt_unit_quit() when quit_param == NXT_QUIT_NORMAL.
    The for-loop is unreachable on the GRACEFUL path (which returns
    early when the active_req queue is non-empty), so the warning's
