"""Tests for debuggable config validation errors.

Covers the additive response fields introduced by roadmap item D5:
 - ``location.path`` (RFC 6901 JSON Pointer to the offending member).
 - ``suggestion`` (best-match member name when the input was a close typo).

Legacy response fields (``error``, ``detail``, ``location.offset/line/column``)
must remain unchanged; several tests guard that.

All cases are expressed using listeners + routes so they run without any
language SAPI module configured.
