"""Proxied responses that RFC 9112 Sect. 6.3 defines as having no body.

nxt_h1p_peer_header_read_done() used to arm the upstream body framing from the
upstream headers alone: Content-Length became h1p->remainder, Transfer-Encoding
armed the chunked parser.  A response to HEAD, and any 204 or 304 response,
carries no body no matter what those headers say, so the upstream -- which
nxt_h1p_peer_header_send() always asks to "Connection: close" -- closed with the
remainder still outstanding.  nxt_h1p_peer_closed() read that as a truncated
body and set r->truncated/r->inconsistent, and nxt_h1p_request_close() then
dropped the client keep-alive, losing any pipelined follow-up request.

Each case pipelines two requests in a single write: the bodyless one, then a
plain GET.  The second response arriving at all is the regression assertion.

1xx is tested in test_proxy_interim.py.

These cases also drive both shapes the header read can take -- with and
without body bytes alongside the header -- but they cannot assert that the
unrelayed header buffer is released: a stranded request pool is invisible from
the client side, and a stock build exposes no pool counter -- nxt_debug is
never assigned, so even a --debug build emits no "mp ... release" lines.  That
was measured instead with a throwaway build that forces nxt_debug on and counts
pools reaching a zero retain per request; see the commit message.

The same hold covers a third path nothing here reaches: an ordinary proxied
response whose body arrives in a read after the header, which stranded the pool
on master as well.  It is unobservable from the client for the same reason, and
is covered by that measurement rather than by an assertion.

See freeunitorg/freeunit#283 for the downstream half of the same rule.
