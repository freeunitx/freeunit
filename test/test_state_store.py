"""Persistence of the state directory (issue #215).

The controller hands each accepted configuration to the main process, which
writes it to <statedir>/conf.json.  That write used to go straight into
conf.json with O_TRUNC, so a store that could not finish left the file
truncated -- and the short-write path unlinked it outright, which is what
this test observes on the unfixed code: a configuration too large for the
filesystem leaves no conf.json at all.

The failure is arranged by putting the state directory on a 64 KiB tmpfs,
which needs root and CAP_SYS_ADMIN (pytest as root in a --privileged
container) as well as --restart; the test skips otherwise.
