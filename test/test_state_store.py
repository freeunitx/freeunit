"""Persistence of the state directory (issue #215).

The controller hands each accepted configuration to the main process, which
writes it to <statedir>/conf.json.  That write used to go straight into
conf.json with O_TRUNC, so a store that could not finish left the file
truncated -- and the short-write path unlinked it outright, which is what
this test observes on the unfixed code: a configuration too large for the
filesystem leaves no conf.json at all.

The failure is arranged by putting the state directory on a 64 KiB tmpfs,
which needs root and CAP_SYS_ADMIN (pytest as root in a --privileged
container) as well as --restart; the test skips otherwise.

Main runs each store in a short-lived child process, one at a time, and waits
for it before it exits (https://github.com/freeunitorg/freeunit/issues/516).
The other tests here check that a configuration answered with 200 is on disk
after an immediate SIGTERM, and that stores in quick succession leave the
last configuration.  They need --restart only.  They catch a regression only
when a store takes longer than the few milliseconds main needs to exit, so on
a tmpfs they pass either way.

The version tests seed a state directory by hand.  unitd writes the version
file with no line end, but a file written by hand often has one.
