"""A worker that starts but never announces itself must not strand the start.

An application process is only ever announced by the process itself, from
nxt_unit_init() -> PROCESS_READY.  A `"type": "external"` binary that never
gets that far -- /bin/sleep is the shortest example, but a wrapper script or a
runtime blocked in its own init reaches the same state -- answers nothing, and
because it stays alive nothing kills it either, so no REMOVE_PID converts the
wait into an error.

Without a "limits": {"start_timeout"} that leaves the router's START_PROCESS
RPC armed for good.  With the default "processes" that RPC is the only
continuation of nxt_router_conf_apply(), so:

  * the configuration PUT never returned, and
  * the controller parks the in-flight request at the head of its queue, so
    nxt_controller_check_postpone_request() queued every later control request
    behind it -- GET /status included.

The whole control plane was unavailable for as long as that process lived.

The bound is opt-in: NXT_APP_START_TIMEOUT is 0, because the window it
measures is the application's own startup and a default would fail a slow but
honest one (see the comment on that macro).  So these tests set it explicitly,
and test_app_start_timeout_default_is_unbounded() pins the default.

Every test here would hang rather than fail on a build without the deadline,
which is why the module is worth running under `timeout` when comparing.

    deadline is how they are told apart: a slow one reads the QUIT out of its
    port the moment nxt_unit_init() starts reading, which is well inside the
    second "start_timeout" it is given here.

    A restart is the shape that catches it, and is what caught it: serving a
    request replenishes the spare, so the application has a worker in the
    middle of its start exactly when the old prototype is told to quit.
