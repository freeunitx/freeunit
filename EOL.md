# FreeUnit Support Policy

FreeUnit supports each language runtime for **1 year after its upstream EOL date**,
and each OS version for **3 years after its upstream EOL date**.
This gives users time to migrate without being forced onto newer versions immediately.

EOL dates are tracked at [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date).

† Past upstream EOL; in FreeUnit grace period.
‡ Default Python shipped by this OS is itself past upstream EOL. FreeUnit does not backport fixes to that Python version.

The "Upstream EOL" column is always the end of *standard* support, per the LTS
rule below — never an extended-maintenance date. Which endoflife.date field that
is depends on the vendor, so `pkg/eol/` picks per category: Ubuntu's `eol` is the
end of standard security maintenance (ESM excluded), while Debian's `eol` became
the end of **LTS** in September 2026, and the Debian Security Team's window — the
one this table tracks — moved to that API's `support` field.

## Dependency Support

Build-time and bundled libraries. These are **not** matrix variants — nothing in
Docker or CI derives an image from this table — so the 1-year grace rule does not
apply to them. Machine-readable copy: the `dependencies` key in `pkg/eol.json`.

† Bundled software that is already past upstream EOL. It carries no FreeUnit "drops"
date, because the grace policy applies to matrix variants, not to vendored jars; it
needs an upgrade or replacement decision instead.

| Dependency | Role | Floor / Version | Upstream EOL | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| OpenSSL | TLS backend (`--openssl`) | 1.1.1 (floor) | Sep 2023 | The floor stays at 1.1.1 rather than 3.x because RHEL 8 still ships a vendor-patched 1.1.1 and Red Hat maintains it into 2029 -- from 2026-09 it is the last platform in the matrix still receiving vendor patches for it. Amazon Linux 2's ended 2026-06-30 and Debian 11's LTS ends 2026-08-31; both remain inside FreeUnit's own three-year post-EOL support window (see `_grace_os` in `pkg/eol.json`). Floor declared by the `auto/ssltls` probe (PR #224). |
| OpenSSL | tested ceiling | 3.5.9 (CI build) | Apr 2030 | `build-test.yml` builds it into `/opt/openssl-3.5` (`OPENSSL_VERSION`). 3.5 is the LTS line. It replaced 3.6.5, which reaches upstream EOL on 2026-11-01. |
| OpenSSL | tested ceiling | 4.0.x (Fedora 45) | May 2027 | The `hardening-strict-fedora` job builds against the `openssl-devel` of the `fedora:45` image, which moves with Fedora updates; the job log prints the exact version. Its gcc leg compiles with `-DOPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED`, so any use of an API that OpenSSL deprecates fails the build. The nightly `openssl4` job (`nightly.yml`) also builds upstream 4.0.3 (`OPENSSL4_VERSION`) from source with the same define. |
| Apache Tomcat | Servlet/JSP/EL API + Jasper jars bundled by the Java module | 9.0.x | Mar 2027 ([no earlier than](https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html)) | Bundled by `auto/modules/java`; independent of the JDK variant. |
| Eclipse Jetty | `jetty-util` / `jetty-server` / `jetty-http` jars bundled by the Java module | 9.4.58.v20250814 | **Aug 2025 (EOL)** † | Jetty 9.4 lost community support on 2025-08-14 and the bundled build is its last release. Needs an upgrade-or-replace decision — Jetty 10/11 are EOL too; 12.x is the supported line. |
| Eclipse ECJ (JDT batch compiler) | JSP compilation jar bundled by the Java module | 3.26.0 | none published | Tracks Eclipse releases; endoflife.date has no product for it. Pinned build is from Jun 2021; current is 3.42.0 (Jun 2025). |
| ClassGraph | classpath scanning jar bundled by the Java module | latest | — | No upstream EOL schedule; pinned and bumped as needed. |
| Wasmtime (C API) | WebAssembly runtime built by `pkg/contrib` and linked by the `wasm` module | 48.0.5 | none published | Fetched as a source tarball (`pkg/contrib/src/wasmtime/version`), so `cargo audit` never sees it; the `Audit (cargo)` pins job queries OSV for the pinned version instead. Same 48.0.5 as the Rust pin below; 48 is a long-term support line. The 47.0.4 to 48.0.5 bump closed twelve advisories from 2026-09-24 and 2026-10-02. The 43.0.1 bump closed RUSTSEC-2026-0269, -0222, -0114 and three wasmtime-wasi path/permission advisories — see #400. |
| Wasmtime (Rust crate) | WebAssembly runtime used by the `wasm-wasi-component` module | 48.0.5 | none published | `src/wasm-wasi-component/Cargo.lock`, audited by the `Audit (cargo)` workflow on every lock. Bumped with the advisories it closes. |

## Rules

- **Adding a runtime version:** when new upstream release reaches stable, FreeUnit adds
  it within one release cycle.
- **Adding an OS version:** when new OS release is available, FreeUnit adds it within
  one release cycle.
- **Dropping a version:** announced at least one release before removal. Noted in
  `CHANGES`.
- **Security-only mode:** versions within 6 months of the FreeUnit drop date receive
  security fixes only — no new features backported.
- **LTS runtimes (Java 17/21/25):** follow the upstream LTS schedule strictly.
- **Dependencies:** the floors in the Dependency Support section are not part of the
  EOL + grace policy; they track what FreeUnit builds and bundles, not what it ships
  as a variant.
- **A dependency pinned twice needs both rows.** Wasmtime is pinned once as a Rust
  crate and once as a source tarball, and only the crate is reachable by `cargo
  audit`. List every pin separately and say which one an automated check covers, so
  a gap between them is visible here rather than only in a lock file.
- **LTS OS (Ubuntu, RHEL, Debian):** 3-year extension applies to standard EOL, not
  extended security maintenance dates.

## Source of Truth

Machine-readable version data lives in [`pkg/eol.json`](pkg/eol.json).
The Docker CI matrix and RPM packaging are driven by this file.

## Reporting EOL Issues

If a runtime or OS version in the matrix has reached upstream EOL and is not yet listed here,
open an issue with the label `eol` at
[github.com/freeunitorg/freeunit/issues](https://github.com/freeunitorg/freeunit/issues).
